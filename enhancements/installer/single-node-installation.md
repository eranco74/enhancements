# Single node installation

Add a new `create aio-ignition` command to `openshift-installer` which
allows a user to create an `aio.ign` Ignition configuration which
launches a minimal all-in-one control plane using static pods.

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [openshift-docs](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/)

## Summary

The new installer `create aio-ignition` command generates an `aio.ign`
file with a minimal all-in-one control plane using static pods. The
installer command will use the same `install-config.yaml` input as the
`create cluster` command.

This minimal control plane is similar to the bootstrap control plane
used in regular installations, and consists only of etcd,
kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler. The key
differences from the usual `bootstrap.ign` configuration are:

- `bootkube.sh` will finish when it sets up the control plane without
  applying all the OpenShift manifests.
- `kubelet` will be configured to be a part of the cluster.

When a user boots a CoreOS image with the `aio.ign` configuration,
they will observe a similar flow as a bootstrap node in a regular
installation, but they will end up with a minimal control plane. The
intent is that the user will be able to expand and customize this
"all-in-one" configuration, but this will be covered by a future
enhancement. There is no intention to allow users to grow these
single-node installations into multi-node installations.

This enhancement can be seen as a first step of what is described in
https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/302

## Motivation

Demonstrate a prototype of creating a simple static Ignition file that
boots an RHCOS machine and launches a basic Kube control plane.

Rob Szumski’s demo of [“Kubelet with no control
plane"](https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/kubelet-no-masters)
shows the possibilities of a single node using Kubelet and static
pods, with no Kubernetes control plane. Rob references a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/dmesser/ffa556788660a7d23999427be4797d38)
which describes how to configure Kubelet, CRI-O, and CNI for this use
case. He also talks about how to use Ignition and CoreOS to configure
such a machine. This proposal differs from Rob’s demo in that we will
use Kubelet to launch a control plane, and actual apps will be
deployed using the regular Kubernetes control plane constructs.

Seth Jennings [rhcos-kaio](https://github.com/sjenning/rhcos-kaio)
prototype shows an AIO Kubernetes control plane could be launched with
Ignition, where the control plane components (like etcd and
kube-apiserver) are managed by systemd. This proposal differs from
Seth’s prototype in that we will use Kubelet managed static pods for
these components.

### Goals

1. Add installer support for creating a single node cluster composed
   of static pods, similar to the installer bootstrap.

### Non-Goals

1. Single Ignition config that can be used for multiple installations
   - the installer must be used to generate the configuration for each
  cluster.
2. Support for expanding this all-in-one cluster to a regular cluster.

## Proposal

When a machine is booted with aio.ign, the aiokube systemd service is
launched (similar to bootkube in the bootstrap ignition).

The new installer `create aio-ignition` command generates an `aio.ign`
file, based on an `install-config.yaml` file. The Ignition
configuration includes assets such as TLS certificates and keys. When
a machine is booted with CoreOS and this Ignition configuration, the
`aiokube` systemd service is launched, which is similar to bootkube in
the bootstrap Ignition.

`aiokube` uses the operators for the minimal control plane components
to render the static pod manifests and related assets. Once those
components have been launched, `kubelet` is configured to join the
cluster.


### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

### Initial POC

What I did:
- Updated the bootkube.sh script
  ([here](https://github.com/eranco74/installer/commit/15c39c5b1bf0e08d8680116bfd9d3f126a05651b))
- Setup the bootstrap control plane (without executing cluster-bootstrap)
- Get the master ignition form the MCS
- Extract the master ignition to disk using MCD --once-from option
- Reload systemd daemon & Restart kubelet service

To try this out:
- Installer branch (https://github.com/eranco74/installer/tree/eran/aio)
- Build the installer (./hack/build.sh)
- Generate ignition (copy install-config.yaml to ./mydir and run make generate)
- Set up networking with `make network` (Provides DNS for `Cluster name: test-cluster, Base DNS: redhat.com`)
- Spin up a VM with the “bootstrap” ignition with `make start`
- Monitor the progress using `make ssh` and `journalctl -f -u bootkube.service`
- Once the API is up, set the master node as schedulable (will be
  removed) using `kubectl --kubeconfig=./mydir/auth/kubeconfig taint node master1 node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule`

Result:

```
$ kubectl --kubeconfig=mydir/auth/kubeconfig  get nodes
NAME      STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
master1   Ready    master   3m17s   v1.18.3+1a1d81c

$ kubectl --kubeconfig=mydir/auth/kubeconfig  get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   bootstrap-kube-apiserver-master1            2/2     Running   0          2m44s
kube-system   bootstrap-kube-controller-manager-master1   1/1     Running   1          2m29s
kube-system   bootstrap-kube-scheduler-master1            1/1     Running   0          2m37s
```

Note that `etcd-metrics`, `etcd-member`, and `cluster-version-operator` are running but don’t show up as pods:

The node is schedulable:

```
oc --kubeconfig=./mydir/auth/kubeconfig get deployment
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           30m
```

Issues:

- At some point the certs will expire (24 hours)!
- Kube-controller-manager (not a real problem) fail in case we don’t have DNS
```

```
- Kubelet fail to register the node when using the master kubeconfig (as a workaround I placed the admin kubeconfig under /etc/kubernetes/)

### Open Questions [optional]

1. Operators are not running in the cluster and we need a way to rotate all certificates with a bash script using oc similar to this:
   https://github.com/code-ready/snc/blame/master/kubelet-bootstrap-cred-manager-ds.yaml.in
   Is this the best way to handle it?
2. Are there any other ways these bootstrap static pods are deficient compared to the regular control plane static pods?
